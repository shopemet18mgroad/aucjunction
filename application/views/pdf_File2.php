<p><b>V.  CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO "ONLINE" AUCTION METHOD OF BIDDING</b></p>

<p>1. Validity: The Online auction bidders and Tender bidders must keep their bids valid for a period of 30
calendar days from the date of closing of e-Auction excluding the date of closing. In case the 30 day
falls on a holiday or remains closed for the Seller, such Bids will be deemed to be automatically
extended to be valid up to the next working day of Seller.
<p>2. Time Extension: If any valid bid is received within the last 3 minutes (“Time Extension” as mentioned
in the Bidding Room will be in force & 3 Minutes is an example) of closing time, the time will be
extended automatically by 3 minutes. Bidders are advised to look for the number of extensions left in
the virtual auction room in cases where the number of time extensions are restricted.
<p>3. Training: MatexNet will provide training (online) if required by the bidders at a mutually convenient
date and time before the Auction.
<p>4. By default, the system will not permit the bidders to increase/decrease (FA/RA) bids beyond a
maximum of five times the prescribed bid increment/decrement. However, this limitation can change
and hence Bidders are advised to contact MatexNet to ascertain about this feature before placing bids.
<p>5. By default, the system will set up the next bid value (current highest/lowest bid value plus or minus
the prescribed minimum increment/decrement). Bidders can use the + or – symbol in the bid box to
increase/decrease the bid values. The bidders can override this feature to place their bids manually
as well. All bid values in figures will be displayed with a comma separator as per International Standards
and all bid values in words will be displayed as per Indian system for numbers.
<p>6. Bids: All bids placed are legally valid bids and are to be considered as bids from the bidder himself.
Once the bid is placed, the Bidders cannot reduce or withdraw the bid for whatever reason. If done
so, the Seller will forfeit the EMD. The highest and the latest bid on the Auction shall supersede all the
previous bids of the bidder. Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching 
Auction ID: Matex979OE Page 10 of 12
that of an auto bid, the manual bid will prevail and be considered. The bidder with the highest offer/
bid does not get any right to demand acceptance of his Bid.
<p>7. For deciding the successful bidder, only the highest bid placed in the Closed Bid event or the Online
Auction will be considered. In the event of a tie (highest offer received in the online closed bid
matching the highest bid received in the e-auction), Seller will decide the successful bidder. No
complaints in this regard will be entertained.
<p>8. Auto Bid: Auto Bid facility is provided for bidders intending to place a maximum value for a lot/lots.
<p>9. Auto Bid: Auto bid is not a confirmed bid. It is only the maximum ceiling amount set by the Bidder to
enable the auction engine to place bids on his behalf, whenever he is out bided, up to the ceiling set
by him.
<p>10. Auto Bid: Once auto bid is set, the auction engine will consider the ceiling amount for the next possible
Bid only, depending on the highest bid prevailing at that point of time and the increment / decrement
amount prescribed for that particular lot. However, Auto Bid cannot be set for amounts less than two
increments / decrements to the highest/lowest bid prevailing at that point of time.
<p>11. Auto Bid: Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching that of auto bid,
the manual bid will prevail and be considered.
